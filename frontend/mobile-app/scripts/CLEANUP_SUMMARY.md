# Project Cleanup Summary

## ðŸ§¹ What Was Cleaned

### Python Virtual Environment (.venv)
Removed problematic TensorFlow packages and dependencies that were causing issues:

**Main Packages Removed:**
- tensorflowjs (4.12.0)
- tensorflow (2.13.0)
- tensorflow-intel (2.13.0)
- keras (2.13.1)
- h5py (3.15.1)
- tensorboard (2.13.0)
- tensorflow-estimator (2.13.0)
- tensorflow-io-gcs-filesystem (0.31.0)

**Leftover Dependencies Removed:**
- absl-py, astunparse, gast
- google-auth, google-auth-oauthlib, google-pasta
- grpcio, libclang
- tensorboard-data-server, termcolor, werkzeug
- numpy (1.24.3), flatbuffers, opt_einsum, protobuf

**Why?**
These packages had complex dependency conflicts that were impossible to resolve locally. Since we're using Google Colab for model conversion, we don't need them.

### Mobile App (frontend/mobile-app)
No changes needed! Package.json is clean and contains only necessary dependencies:

**Key Dependencies (Still Needed):**
- âœ… @tensorflow/tfjs (4.22.0) - For running models in React Native
- âœ… @tensorflow/tfjs-react-native (1.0.0) - Platform adapter
- âœ… react-native-fs (2.20.0) - File system access
- âœ… base-64, text-encoding - Encoding utilities
- âœ… expo-* packages - Expo SDK dependencies

## ðŸ“Š Current Status

### Python Environment (Clean)
```
.venv/ - Contains only basic Python packages
â”œâ”€â”€ pip, setuptools, wheel
â”œâ”€â”€ requests, urllib3, certifi (HTTP clients)
â”œâ”€â”€ Standard utilities (typing_extensions, packaging, etc.)
â””â”€â”€ No TensorFlow packages âœ…
```

### Mobile App (Ready)
```
frontend/mobile-app/
â”œâ”€â”€ package.json - All dependencies installed âœ…
â”œâ”€â”€ node_modules/ - Clean, no conflicts âœ…
â””â”€â”€ App running successfully âœ…
```

## ðŸŽ¯ Next Steps

1. **Convert model in Google Colab** (See CONVERT_MODEL_IN_COLAB.md)
2. **Copy converted files** to `assets/models/tfjs/`
3. **Update modelService.js** to load from tfjs directory
4. **Test the app** with real model predictions

## âœ… Benefits of This Cleanup

- **No more dependency conflicts** - Python environment is minimal
- **Faster development** - No wrestling with TensorFlow locally
- **Reproducible** - Colab conversion works consistently
- **Smaller virtual environment** - Removed ~300MB of unused packages
- **Clear separation** - Model conversion (Colab) vs Model inference (React Native)

## ðŸ”§ If You Need to Convert Again

Just open the `CONVERT_MODEL_IN_COLAB.md` file and follow the instructions. No local setup needed!
