# Email Verification UI Changes

## Summary
Added email verification functionality to the Profile Screen, allowing users to verify their email addresses directly from their profile.

## Changes Made

### 1. AuthService (`frontend/mobile-app/src/services/authService.js`)
Added three new methods to handle email verification:

- **`sendVerificationPin(email)`** - Sends a 6-digit PIN to the user's email
- **`verifyEmailWithPin(email, pin)`** - Verifies the email using the PIN and updates local user data
- **`checkVerificationStatus(email)`** - Checks if an email is verified

### 2. ProfileScreen (`frontend/mobile-app/src/screens/ProfileScreen.js`)
Enhanced the profile screen with verification functionality:

#### New Features:
- **Verification Badge**: Shows verification status with colored badge (green for verified, orange for unverified)
- **Clickable Account Status**: Unverified users can tap the "Account Status" field to start verification
- **Verification Modal**: Modal popup for entering the 6-digit PIN
- **PIN Input**: Dedicated input field for 6-digit verification code
- **Resend PIN**: Option to request a new PIN if needed
- **Real-time Updates**: User data refreshes after successful verification

#### UI Components Added:
1. Modal with verification form
2. PIN input field (6 digits, centered, large text)
3. Verify button with loading state
4. Resend PIN button
5. Badge indicators for verification status

#### User Flow:
1. User sees "Not Verified" badge on Account Status
2. Taps on Account Status row
3. System sends PIN to user's email
4. Modal opens for PIN entry
5. User enters 6-digit PIN
6. On success, modal closes and badge updates to "Verified"
7. User can resend PIN if needed

## API Endpoints Used
- `POST /auth/send-verification-pin` - Send PIN to email
- `POST /auth/verify-email` - Verify email with PIN
- `GET /auth/verification-status` - Check verification status

## Testing
- Syntax validation completed successfully
- No syntax errors in modified files
- All theme colors (success, warning) are properly configured

## Next Steps
1. Test verification flow in development mode
2. Verify email sending works properly
3. Test PIN validation and error handling
4. Ensure proper UX for already verified accounts
