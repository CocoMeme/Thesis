# Training Setup Summary - Optimized for Your Dataset

## Your Dataset Structure
```
Google Drive/
â””â”€â”€ MyDrive/
    â””â”€â”€ EGourd/
        â””â”€â”€ Senior_Datasets/
            â”œâ”€â”€ ampalayabilog female/  (507 images)
            â””â”€â”€ ampalayabilog male/    (496 images)
```

## Changes Made to Training Code

### 1. **Path Configuration** âœ…
- Updated paths to match your Google Drive structure
- Changed from ZIP extraction to direct folder access
- Added path verification with image counts

**Before:**
```python
DRIVE_BASE_PATH = '/content/drive/MyDrive/AmpalayaDataset'
FEMALE_DATASET_ZIP = f'{DRIVE_BASE_PATH}/female_dataset.zip'
MALE_DATASET_ZIP = f'{DRIVE_BASE_PATH}/male_dataset.zip'
```

**After:**
```python
DRIVE_BASE_PATH = '/content/drive/MyDrive/EGourd/Senior_Datasets'
FEMALE_DATASET_DIR = f'{DRIVE_BASE_PATH}/ampalayabilog female'
MALE_DATASET_DIR = f'{DRIVE_BASE_PATH}/ampalayabilog male'
```

### 2. **Dataset Organization** âœ…
- Removed ZIP extraction logic (not needed)
- Direct folder access and file copying
- Preserves original file extensions
- Added reproducible random seed (42)
- Better progress reporting with totals

### 3. **Optimized Hyperparameters** âœ…
For ~1,000 images dataset:

| Parameter | Before | After | Reason |
|-----------|--------|-------|--------|
| `BATCH_SIZE` | 32 | 16 | Better for smaller datasets |
| `EPOCHS` | 50 | 100 | More training potential |
| `Early Stopping Patience` | 10 | 15 | More time to learn |
| `LR Reduction Patience` | 5 | 7 | Less aggressive reduction |

### 4. **Enhanced Data Augmentation** âœ…
Increased augmentation to compensate for smaller dataset:

| Augmentation | Before | After |
|--------------|--------|-------|
| Rotation | 20Â° | 40Â° |
| Width/Height Shift | 0.2 | 0.3 |
| Zoom Range | 0.2 | 0.3 |
| Brightness | [0.8, 1.2] | [0.7, 1.3] |
| Channel Shift | Not used | 20 |

### 5. **Added Sample Visualization** âœ…
New function to preview training images before training:
- Shows 8 samples from each class
- Helps verify data quality
- Saves visualization as PNG

### 6. **Better Progress Reporting** âœ…
- Added detailed summaries after each step
- Shows exact image counts per split
- Displays training configuration clearly
- Better visual separators with "=" lines

## Expected Data Split

Based on 1,003 total images (507 female + 496 male):

| Split | Percentage | Female | Male | Total |
|-------|-----------|--------|------|-------|
| **Training** | 70% | ~355 | ~347 | ~702 |
| **Validation** | 15% | ~76 | ~74 | ~150 |
| **Test** | 15% | ~76 | ~75 | ~151 |

## Training Time Estimates (T4 GPU)

- **Phase 1 (Frozen Base)**: 15-30 minutes
- **Phase 2 (Fine-tuning)**: 20-60 minutes
- **Total Expected**: 35-90 minutes
- **Note**: Early stopping may finish earlier if optimal performance is reached

## Performance Expectations

With your dataset size and quality:

| Metric | Conservative | Realistic | Optimistic |
|--------|-------------|-----------|------------|
| **Accuracy** | 80-85% | 85-92% | 92-95% |
| **Precision** | 78-83% | 83-90% | 90-94% |
| **Recall** | 78-83% | 83-90% | 90-94% |
| **F1 Score** | 78-83% | 83-90% | 90-94% |

*Note: Actual results depend on:*
- Image quality and clarity
- Distinctiveness of male vs female features
- Lighting and background consistency
- Camera angles and distances

## Memory Usage (T4 GPU)

With current settings:
- **Batch size**: 16
- **Image size**: 224x224x3
- **Model**: MobileNetV2 (~3.5M parameters)
- **Expected VRAM usage**: 2-4 GB (out of 16 GB available)
- **Safety margin**: 12+ GB free âœ…

## Steps to Run

1. **Mount Google Drive**
   ```python
   drive.mount('/content/drive')
   ```

2. **Verify paths exist** (automatic)
   - Code will check and report image counts

3. **Enable T4 GPU**
   - Runtime â†’ Change runtime type â†’ T4 GPU â†’ Save

4. **Run all cells in sequence**
   - Follow the numbered sections (1-17)

5. **Monitor training**
   - Watch accuracy and loss curves
   - Check for overfitting

6. **Download trained model**
   - Model saved to Google Drive automatically
   - Also saved as TFLite for mobile deployment

## Key Files Generated

After training completes:

| File | Size | Purpose |
|------|------|---------|
| `ampalaya_classifier.h5` | ~14 MB | Full Keras model |
| `ampalaya_classifier.tflite` | ~3-4 MB | Mobile-optimized model |
| `model_metadata.json` | <1 KB | Model configuration & metrics |
| `training_history.png` | <1 MB | Training visualization |
| `best_model.h5` | ~14 MB | Best checkpoint during training |
| `sample_images.png` | <1 MB | Preview of training data |

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: "Dataset not found"
**Solution**: Check folder names match exactly:
- `ampalayabilog female` (with space, no capitals in "female")
- `ampalayabilog male` (with space, no capitals in "male")

### Issue: "Out of Memory"
**Solution**: Batch size already optimized to 16. If still issues, reduce to 8.

### Issue: "Training too slow"
**Solution**: Verify T4 GPU is enabled:
```python
print(tf.config.list_physical_devices('GPU'))
# Should show: [PhysicalDevice(name='/physical_device:GPU:0', device_type='GPU')]
```

### Issue: "Accuracy stuck at 50%"
**Solution**: Model is guessing randomly. Possible causes:
- Images not properly separated into folders
- Images are too similar between classes
- Learning rate too high/low

### Issue: "Overfitting (val_loss increasing)"
**Solution**: Already handled by:
- Early stopping callback
- Dropout layers (0.3 and 0.2)
- Enhanced data augmentation

## Next Steps After Training

1. **Evaluate Results**
   - Check test accuracy (target: >85%)
   - Review confusion matrix if needed

2. **Download Model**
   - TFLite file for Expo app
   - Metadata JSON for preprocessing

3. **Integrate into Expo App**
   - Place `.tflite` in assets folder
   - Use preprocessing from metadata
   - Implement inference as shown in guide

4. **Test on Real Photos**
   - Use phone camera
   - Try different lighting conditions
   - Verify confidence scores

## Code Quality Improvements

âœ… **Better error handling** - Checks if paths exist  
âœ… **Reproducibility** - Random seed set to 42  
âœ… **Progress tracking** - Detailed summaries at each step  
âœ… **File organization** - Preserves original extensions
