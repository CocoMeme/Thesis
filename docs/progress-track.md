## Notes & Decisions

- **Date:** Sep 9, 2025 - Project structure defined, setup guide created
- **Date:** Sep 14, 2025 - **MAJOR DECISION**: Migrated from bare React Native to Expo managed workflow
  - **Rationale**: Faster development, easier camera integration, better development experience
  - **Impact**: Accelerated frontend development timeline by ~1 week
- **Date:** Sep 23, 2025 - **MAJOR DECISION**: Changed from Firebase to Google Cloud Console only
  - **Rationale**: Simplified authentication flow, direct Google OAuth 2.0 integration
  - **Impact**: Need to refactor authentication middleware and remove Firebase dependencies
- **Architecture:** Hybrid approach with on-device + server-side ML processing
- **Tech Stack:** **Expo + React Native** + Node.js + MongoDB + PyTorch/TensorFlow + Google Cloud Console OAuth
- **Deployment:** Mobile apps (Android/iOS via Expo) + cloud backend

### Technical Decisions Made
1. **Frontend Framework**: Expo managed workflow over bare React Native
2. **Navigation**: React Navigation 6 with bottom tabs primary navigation
3. **UI Components**: Custom components + React Native Paper for Material Design
4. **Camera Integration**: expo-camera for consistent cross-platform experience
5. **Development Workflow**: Expo Go for mobile testing + web preview for rapid iteration
6. **Authentication System**: Google Cloud Console OAuth 2.0 instead of Firebase Authentication
