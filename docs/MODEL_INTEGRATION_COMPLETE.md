# ✅ Model Integration Complete

**Date:** October 31, 2025  
**Status:** Ready for Testing  

---

## 🎉 What We Just Did

### 1. Model Conversion ✅
- Converted Keras `.h5` model to TensorFlow.js format using Google Colab
- Generated files:
  - `model.json` (model architecture)
  - `group1-shard1of3.bin` (weights part 1/3)
  - `group1-shard2of3.bin` (weights part 2/3)
  - `group1-shard3of3.bin` (weights part 3/3)
- Total size: ~22.52 MB

### 2. Files Copied ✅
- Placed converted model files in: `assets/models/tfjs/`
- All 4 files successfully copied

### 3. Code Updates ✅
Updated `src/services/modelService.js`:

#### ✅ Real Model Loading
```javascript
// BEFORE: Placeholder model (random predictions)
this.model = tf.sequential({ ... });

// AFTER: Real trained model
this.model = await tf.loadLayersModel(
  tf.io.bundleResourceIO(modelJson, modelWeights)
);
```

#### ✅ Real Image Preprocessing
```javascript
// BEFORE: Random tensor
const imageTensor = tf.randomUniform([224, 224, 3]);

// AFTER: Actual image decoding
let imageTensor = tf.browser.fromPixels(imgElement);
imageTensor = imageTensor.div(255.0);  // Normalize
imageTensor = imageTensor.expandDims(0);  // Add batch dimension
```

### 4. Already Implemented ✅
These were already set up in your app:
- ✅ CameraScreen integrated with modelService
- ✅ Model initialization on mount with warm-up
- ✅ Error handling for model loading failures
- ✅ ResultsScreen for displaying predictions
- ✅ Navigation configured (Camera → Results)
- ✅ All exports properly set up

## 🧪 Testing Checklist

### Phase 1: Basic Functionality Test

1. **Start the App**
   ```powershell
   npm run start
   ```

2. **Check Console Logs**
   Look for these messages during app startup:
   ```
   🤖 Initializing TensorFlow.js...
   ✅ TensorFlow ready - Backend: cpu
   📄 Loading model metadata...
   ✅ Metadata loaded: ampalaya_classifier
   🔄 Loading TensorFlow.js model...
   ✅ Real TensorFlow.js model loaded successfully
   📊 Model summary:
      Input shape: [null, 224, 224, 3]
      Output shape: [null, 1]
      Total parameters: [should show actual number]
   ✅ Model service ready
   🔥 Model warmed up
   ```

3. **Test Camera Flow**
   - Navigate to Camera screen
   - Take a photo or pick from gallery
   - Press "Analyze" button
   - Check console for:
     ```
     🔍 Analyzing image...
     🖼️ Preprocessing image...
     ✅ Image resized to 224×224
     ✅ Image preprocessed: {shape: [1, 224, 224, 3], dtype: float32}
     🧠 Running model inference...
     ✅ Prediction complete: {gender: 'male/female', confidence: XX.X%, ...}
     ```

4. **Check Results Screen**
   - Should show predicted gender (Male/Female)
   - Should show confidence percentage
   - Should display the captured image
   - All buttons should work (Retake, Save)

---

## 🔍 What to Look For

### ✅ Good Signs
- Model loads without errors
- Processing time < 3 seconds
- Confidence levels vary based on image quality
- Gender predictions make sense for actual flower images
- Memory usage is stable (check console logs)

### ⚠️ Warning Signs
- Very low confidence (<60%) on clear images
- Always predicts same gender regardless of input
- Processing time > 5 seconds
- Memory leaks (increasing tensor count)
- App crashes when analyzing images

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Issue: Model fails to load
**Error:** `Failed to load model: ...`

**Solutions:**
1. Check that all 4 files are in `assets/models/tfjs/`
2. Verify file names match exactly:
   - `model.json`
   - `group1-shard1of3.bin`
   - `group1-shard2of3.bin`
   - `group1-shard3of3.bin`
3. Clear Metro bundler cache:
   ```powershell
   npm start -- --reset-cache
   ```

### Issue: Image preprocessing fails
**Error:** `Failed to preprocess image: ...`

**Solutions:**
1. Check image URI is valid (starts with `file://` or `data:`)
2. Ensure image manipulation permissions are granted
3. Try with a different image format (JPEG vs PNG)

### Issue: Predictions seem random
**Behavior:** Same confidence for all images, or predictions don't match actual flower gender

**Solutions:**
1. Verify model was trained on correct dataset
2. Check input normalization (should be [0, 1] range)
3. Confirm image preprocessing matches training preprocessing
4. Try with images from the original training set first

### Issue: Slow performance
**Behavior:** Takes >5 seconds per prediction

**Solutions:**
1. Check device performance (older devices will be slower)
2. Verify TensorFlow.js is using optimal backend (check logs)
3. Consider model optimization (quantization) if consistently slow
4. Test on physical device instead of simulator

## 📊 Expected Performance

### On Modern Devices (2021+)
- Model loading: 2-3 seconds (one time)
- Warm-up: <1 second (one time)
- Per prediction: 0.5-1.5 seconds
- Memory usage: ~50-100 MB

### On Older Devices (2018-2020)
- Model loading: 5-7 seconds (one time)
- Warm-up: 1-2 seconds (one time)
- Per prediction: 2-4 seconds
- Memory usage: ~100-200 MB

## 🎯 Next Steps After Testing

### If Everything Works ✅
1. **Test with real flower photos**
   - Take photos of actual ampalaya male flowers
   - Take photos of actual ampalaya female flowers
   - Compare predictions with known gender

2. **Test edge cases**
   - Blurry images
   - Poor lighting
   - Non-flower images
   - Multiple flowers in frame

3. **Backend Integration** (Phase 2)
   - Implement scan saving to database
   - Add history functionality
   - Test result persistence

4. **User Feedback System** (Phase 3)
   - Add "Is this correct?" feedback
   - Collect edge cases for model improvement
   - Track accuracy metrics

### If Issues Occur ⚠️
1. **Document the problem**
   - Screenshot error messages
   - Copy console logs
   - Note device/platform details

2. **Try these diagnostics**
   ```javascript
   // Add to CameraScreen after model initialization:
   const modelInfo = modelService.getModelInfo();
   console.log('Model Info:', modelInfo);
   
   const memoryInfo = modelService.getMemoryInfo();
   console.log('Memory Info:', memoryInfo);
   ```

3. **Share findings**
   - Let me know what's not working
   - Provide error logs
   - I'll help troubleshoot
